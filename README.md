Use SQL to query and analyze data related to savings accounts and generate bank capital mobilization reports

## **1. INTRODUCTION**

The data includes detailed information about customers' savings accounts, such as customer ID, deposit date, maturity date, interest rate, principal amount, interest amount, and account status. Some key points in the data are:

- Deposit and maturity dates: Track the start and maturity dates of the deposits.
- Interest rate: The interest rate applied to each deposit period.
- Total deposit and interest amount: The initial amount deposited and the interest generated from that amount.
- Automatic renewal: Some accounts are set to automatically renew upon maturity.

## **2. THE GOAL OF PROJECT**

 The overall purpose is to help the bank better manage the capital raised through savings accounts, forecast liquidity needs, and analyze customer behavior based on deposit size.
